    <h1 id="name"> ELON MUSK</h1>

    <h2 class="bio">Biography</h2>
    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of apartheid South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia. Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. He was baptized into the Anglican Church.

Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the Musk children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father. He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.

As a child Musk's adenoids were removed because doctors suspected he was deaf, but his mother later decided that he was just thinking "in another world". Aged 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500. In his biography, Ashlee Vance described Elon as an awkward and introverted child. He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.
<h2 class="edn">Education</h2>
Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk tried to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch a startup.
